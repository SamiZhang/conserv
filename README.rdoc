# Conserv

## Purpose
Conserv is an application that allows users to keep track of their water consumption.  Each user of the app installs a Raspberry Pi in their bathroom.  The Pi is connected to a temperature and humidty sensor which it uses to gather data about shower duration.  Showers are assigned points based on their duration, with lower scores representing shorter showers.  Thru the app, users can interact and see visual representations of the data and track their progress over time.  Users can also create or join a house to and compete against their housemates to see who has the lowest score and is therefore conserving the most water.
